## REGULATION  (EU)  2015/2365  OF  THE  EUROPEAN  PARLIAMENT  AND  OF  THE  COUNCIL

of  25  November  2015

on  transparency  of  securities  financing  transactions  and  of  reuse  and  amending  Regulation  (EU) No  648/2012

(Text  with  EEA  relevance)

THE  EUROPEAN  PARLIAMENT  AND  THE  COUNCIL  OF  THE  EUROPEAN  UNION,

Having  regard  to  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union,  and  in  particular  Article  114  thereof,

Having  regard  to  the  proposal  from  the  European  Commission,

After  transmission  of  the  draft  legislative  act  to  the  national  parliaments,

Having  regard  to  the  opinion  of  the  European  Central  Bank (  1  ),

Having  regard  to  the  opinion  of  the  European  Economic  and  Social  Committee (  2  ),

Having  regard  to  the  opinion  of  the  Committee  of  Regions (  3  )

Acting  in  accordance  with  the  ordinary  legislative  procedure (  4 ),

Whereas:

- (1) The  global  financial  crisis  that  emerged  in  2007-2008  has  revealed  excessive  speculative  activities,  important regulatory  gaps,  ineffective  supervision,  opaque  markets  and  overly  complex  products  in  the  financial  system. The  Union  has  adopted  a  range  of  measures  in  order  to  render  the  banking  system  more  solid  and  more  stable, including  strengthening  capital  requirements,  rules  on  improved  governance  and  supervision  and  resolution regimes,  and  to  ensure  that  the  financial  system  fulfils  its  role  in  directing  capital  towards  the  financing  of  the real  economy.  Progress  made  on  the  establishment  of  the  banking  union  is  also  decisive  in  this  context.  However, the  crisis  has  also  highlighted  the  need  to  improve  transparency  and  monitoring  not  only  in  the  traditional banking  sector  but  also  in  areas  where  bank-like  credit  intermediation  known  as  'shadow  banking',  takes  place, the  scale  of  which  is  alarming,  having  already  been  estimated  to  amount  to  close  to  half  of  the  regulated  banking system.  Any  shortcomings  with  regard  to  those  activities,  which  are  similar  to  those  carried  out  by  credit institutions,  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  rest  of  the  financial  sector.

( 4 )  Position  of  the  European  Parliament  of  29  October  2015  (not  yet  published  in  the  Official  Journal)  and  decision  of  the  Council  of 16  November  2015.

- (2) In  the  context  of  its  work  to  curb  shadow  banking,  the  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  and  the  European  Systemic Risk  Board  (ESRB)  established  by  Regulation  (EU)  No  1092/2010  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Coun­ cil (  1  )  have identified the risks posed by securities financing transactions (SFTs). SFTs allow the build-up of leverage, pro-cyclicality  and  interconnectedness  in  the  financial  markets.  In  particular,  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the  use  of SFTs  has  prevented  regulators  and  supervisors  as  well  as  investors  from  correctly  assessing  and  monitoring  the respective  bank-like  risks  and  level  of  interconnectedness  in  the  financial  system  in  the  period  preceding  and during  the  financial  crisis.  Against  this  background,  on  29  August  2013,  the  FSB  adopted  the  policy  framework entitled  'Strengthening  Oversight  and  Regulation  of  Shadow  Banking'  ('FSB  Policy  Framework')  for  addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos, which was endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders.
- (3) On 14 October 2014, the FSB published a regulatory framework for haircuts on non-centrally cleared SFTs. In the absence  of  clearing,  such  operations  raise  major  risks  if  they  are  not  properly  collateralised.  While  enhancing transparency  in  the  reuse  of  client  assets  would  be  a  first  step  towards  facilitating  counterparties'  capacity  to analyse and prevent risks, the FSB is due to  complete its work, by 2016,  on  a set of recommendations on haircuts on  non-centrally  cleared  SFTs  to  prevent  excessive  leveraging  and  mitigate  concentration  risk  and  default  risk.
- (4) On  19  March  2012,  the  Commission  published  a  Green  Paper  on  Shadow  Banking.  Based  on  the  extensive feedback  received  and  taking  into  account  international  developments,  the  Commission  issued,  on  4  September 2013, a communication to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Shadow Banking - Addressing New Sources  of  Risk  in  the  Financial  sector'.  The  Communication  stressed  that  the  complex  and  opaque  nature  of  SFTs makes  it  difficult  to  identify  counterparties  and  monitor  risk  concentration  and  also  leads  to  the  build-up  of excessive  leverage  in  the  financial  system.
- (5) A  high-level  expert  group  chaired  by  Erkki  Liikanen  adopted  a  report  on  reforming  the  structure  of  the  Union banking sector in October 2012. It considered, among other things, the interaction between the traditional and the shadow  banking  systems.  The  report  recognised  the  risks  of  shadow  banking  activities  such  as  high  leverage  and pro-cyclicality,  and  it  called  for  a  reduction  of  the  interconnectedness  between  banks  and  the  shadow  banking system,  which  had  been  a  source  of  contagion  in  a  system-wide  banking  crisis.  The  report  also  suggested  certain structural  measures  to  deal  with  remaining  weaknesses  in  the  Union  banking  sector.
- (6) Structural  reforms  of  the  Union  banking  system  are  dealt  with  in  a  proposal  for  a  regulation  of  the  European Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  structural  measures  improving  the  resilience  of  EU  credit  institutions.  However, imposing structural measures on banks could result in certain activities being shifted to less-regulated areas such as the  shadow  banking  sector.  That  proposal  should  therefore  be  accompanied  by  the  binding  transparency  and reporting  requirements  for  SFTs  laid  down  in  this  Regulation.  Thus,  the  transparency  rules  laid  down  in  this Regulation  complement  that  proposal.
- (7) This  Regulation  responds  to  the  need  to  enhance  the  transparency  of  securities  financing  markets  and  thus  of  the financial  system.  In  order  to  ensure  equivalent  conditions  of  competition  and  international  convergence,  this Regulation  follows  the  FSB  Policy  Framework.  It  creates  a  Union  framework  under  which  details  of  SFTs  can be  efficiently  reported  to  trade  repositories  and  information  on  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps  is  disclosed  to investors in collective investment undertakings. The definition of SFT in this Regulation does not include derivative contracts as  defined  in  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European Parliament and  of  the  Council (  2  ).  However, it  includes  transactions  that  are  commonly  referred  to  as  liquidity  swaps  and  collateral  swaps,  which  do  not  fall under the definition of derivative contracts in Regulation (EU)  No  648/2012. The need for international convergence  is  reinforced  by  the  probability  that,  following  structural  reform  of  the  Union  banking  sector, activities  that  are  currently  exercised  by  traditional  banks  might  migrate  to  the  shadow  banking  sector  and encompass  financial  and  non-financial  entities.  Therefore,  even  less  transparency  may  arise  for  regulators  and supervisors  in  respect  of  those  activities,  preventing  them  from  obtaining  a  proper  overview  of  the  risks  linked  to SFTs.  This  would  only  aggravate  already  well  established  links  between  the  regulated  and  the  shadow  banking sectors  in  particular  markets.

(  1  )  Regulation  (EU)  No  1092/2010  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  24  November  2010  on  European  Union  macroprudential  oversight  of  the  financial  system  and  establishing  a  European  Systemic  Risk  Board  (OJ  L  331,  15.12.2010,  p.  1).

(  2  )  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  4  July  2012  on  OTC  derivatives,  central  counter­ parties  and  trade  repositories  (OJ  L  201,  27.7.2012,  p.  1).

- (8) The  evolution  of  market  practices  and  technological  developments  enable  market  participants  to  use  transactions other than SFTs as a source of funding, for liquidity and collateral management, as a yield-enhancement strategy, to cover  short  sales  or  for  dividend  tax  arbitrage.  Such  transactions  could  have  an  equivalent  economic  effect  and pose  risks  similar  to  SFTs,  including  pro-cyclicality  brought  about  by  fluctuating  asset  values  and  volatility; maturity  or  liquidity  transformation  stemming  from  financing  long-term  or  illiquid  assets  through  short-term  or liquid  assets;  and  financial  contagion  arising  from  interconnectedness  of  chains  of  transactions  involving  collateral reuse.
- (9) In  order  to  respond  to  the  issues  raised  by  the  FSB  Policy  Framework  and  the  developments  envisaged  following structural  reform  of  the  Union  banking  sector,  Member  States  are  likely  to  adopt  divergent  national  measures which could  create  obstacles  to  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  internal  market  and  be  to  the  detriment  of  market participants  and  financial  stability.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  harmonised  transparency  rules  makes  it  difficult  for national authorities to compare  the  micro-level  data  stemming  from  different  Member  States  and thus to understand  the  real  risks  individual  market  participants  pose  to  the  system.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  prevent such  distortions  and  obstacles  from  arising  in  the  Union.  Consequently,  the  appropriate  legal  basis  for  this Regulation  is  Article  114  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union  (TFEU),  as  interpreted  in accordance  with  the  consistent  case-law  of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union.
- (10) The  new  rules  on  transparency  should  therefore  provide  for  the  reporting  of  details  regarding  SFTs  concluded  by all  market  participants,  whether  they  are  financial  or  non-financial  entities,  including  the  composition  of  the collateral,  whether  the  collateral  is  available  for  reuse  or  has  been  reused,  the  substitution  of  collateral  at  the end  of  the  day  and  the  haircuts  applied.  In  order  to  minimise  additional  operational  costs  for  market  participants, the  new  rules  and  standards  should  build  on  pre-existing  infrastructures, operational  processes  and  formats  which have  been  introduced  with  regard  to  reporting  derivative  contracts  to  trade  repositories.  In  that  context,  the European  Supervisory  Authority  (European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority)  ('ESMA')  established  by  Regulation (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council (  1  )  should,  to  the  extent  feasible  and  relevant, minimise  overlaps  and  avoid  inconsistencies  between  the  technical  standards  adopted  pursuant  to  this  Regulation and  those  adopted  pursuant to  Article  9  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012.  The  legal  framework  laid  down  by  this Regulation  should,  to  the  extent  possible,  be  the  same  as  that  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  in  respect  of  the reporting  of  derivative  contracts  to  trade  repositories  registered  for  that  purpose.  This  should  also  enable  trade repositories registered or recognised in accordance with that Regulation to fulfil the repository function assigned by this  Regulation,  if  they  comply  with  certain  additional  criteria,  subject  to  completion  of  a  simplified  registration process.
- (11) In order to ensure consistency and effectiveness of ESMA's powers to impose penalties, the market participants that fall  within  the  scope  of  this  Regulation  should,  by  reference  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012,  be  subject  to  the provisions  regarding  ESMA's  powers  as  laid  down  in  that  Regulation  as  specified,  in  respect  of  the  rules  of procedure,  by  the  delegated  acts  adopted  pursuant  to  Article  64(7)  of  that  Regulation.
- (12) Transactions  with  members  of  the  European  System  of  Central  Banks  (ESCB)  should  be  exempted  from  the obligation  to  report  SFTs  to  trade  repositories.  However,  in  order  to  ensure  that  regulators  and  supervisors obtain  a  proper  overview  of  the  risks  linked  to  SFTs  concluded  by  the  entities  they  regulate  or  supervise,  the relevant  authorities  and  the  members  of  the  ESCB  should  cooperate  closely.  Such  cooperation  should  enable regulators  and  supervisors  to  fulfil  their  respective  responsibilities  and  mandates.  Such  cooperation  should  be confidential,  and  conditional  on  a  justified  request  from  the  relevant  competent  authorities,  and  should  only  be provided with a view to enabling those authorities to fulfil their respective responsibilities having due regard to the principles and  requirements  of  the  independence  of  central  banks  and  the  performance  by  them  of  their  functions as  monetary  authorities,  including  the  performance  of  monetary,  foreign  exchange  and  financial  stability  policy operations  which  members  of  the  ESCB  are  legally  empowered  to  pursue.  The  members  of  the  ESCB  should  be able  to  refuse  to  provide  information  where  the  transactions  are  entered  into  by  them  in  the  performance  of  their functions  as  monetary  authorities.  They  should  notify  the  requesting  authority  of  any  such  refusal  together  with the  justification  therefor.
- (13) Information on the risks inherent in securities financing markets should be  centrally stored, and  easily and  directly accessible by, inter alia, ESMA, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority)

(  1  )  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  24  November  2010  establishing  a  European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and  Markets  Authority), amending  Decision  No  716/2009/EC  and  repealing Commission Decision  2009/77/EC  (OJ  L  331,  15.12.2010,  p.  84).

('EBA')  established  by  Regulation  (EU)  No  1093/2010  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council (  1  ),  the European  Supervisory  Authority  (European  Insurance  and  Occupational  Pensions  Authority)  ('EIOPA')  established by  Regulation  (EU)  No  1094/2010  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council (  2  ),  the  relevant  competent authorities,  the  ESRB  and  the  relevant  central  banks  of  the  ESCB,  including  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB)  in carrying out  its  tasks  within  a  single  supervisory mechanism  under  Council  Regulation (EU)  No  1024/2013 (  3  ),  for the  purpose  of  identification  and  monitoring  of  financial  stability  risks  entailed  by  shadow  banking  activities  of regulated  and non-regulated  entities.  ESMA  should  take  into consideration the technical  standards  adopted pursuant  to  Article  81  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  regulating  trade  repositories  for  derivative  contracts and  the  future  development  of  those  technical  standards  when  drawing  up  or  proposing  to  revise  the  regulatory technical  standards  provided  for  in  this  Regulation.  ESMA  should  also  aim  to  ensure  that  the  relevant  competent authorities,  the  ESRB  and  the  relevant  central  banks  of  the  ESCB,  including  the  ECB,  have  direct  and  immediate access  to  the  information  necessary  to  perform  their  duties,  including  to  define  and  implement  monetary  policy and  to  perform  oversight  of  financial  market  infrastructures.  In  order  to  ensure  this,  ESMA  should  set  out  the terms  and  conditions  for  access  to  such  information  in  draft  regulatory  technical  standards.

- (14) It  is  necessary  to  introduce  provisions  on  the  exchange  of  information  between  competent  authorities  and  to strengthen  the  duties  of  assistance  and  cooperation  which  they  owe  each  other.  Due  to  increasing  cross-border activity,  competent  authorities  should  provide  each  other  with  the  relevant  information  for  the  exercise  of  their functions in order to ensure the effective enforcement of this Regulation, including in situations where infringements  or  suspected  infringements  may  be  of  concern  to  authorities  in  two  or  more  Member  States.  In the  exchange  of  information,  strict  professional  secrecy  is  needed  to  ensure  the  smooth  transmission  of  that information  and  the  protection  of  particular  rights.  Without  prejudice  to  national  criminal  or  tax  law,  the competent  authorities,  ESMA,  bodies  or  natural  or  legal  persons  other  than  the  competent  authorities,  which receive  confidential  information,  should  use  it  only  in  the  performance  of  their  duties  and  for  the  exercise  of  their functions.  However,  this  should  not  prevent  the  exercise,  in  accordance  with  national  law,  of  the  functions  of national  bodies  responsible  for  the  prevention,  investigation  or  correction  of  cases  of  maladministration.
- (15) SFTs  are  used  extensively  by  managers  of  collective  investment  undertakings  for  efficient  portfolio  management. Such  use  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  performance  of  those  collective  investment  undertakings.  SFTs  can be  used  either  to  fulfil  investment  objectives  or  to  enhance  returns.  Managers  also  make  use  of  total  return  swaps which  have  effects  equivalent  to  SFTs.  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps  are  extensively  used  by  managers  of  collective investment undertakings to get exposure to certain strategies or to enhance their returns. The use of SFTs and total return  swaps  could  increase  the  general  risk  profile  of  the  collective  investment  undertaking  whereas  their  use  is not  properly disclosed  to  investors.  It  is  crucial  to  ensure  that  investors  in  such  collective  investment  undertakings are  able  to  make  informed  choices  and  to  assess  the  overall  risk  and  reward  profile  of  collective  investment undertakings.  When  assessing  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps,  the  collective  investment  undertaking  should  consider the  substance  of  the  transaction  in  addition  to  its  legal  form.
- (16) Investments  made  on  the  basis  of  incomplete  or  inaccurate  information  as  regards  a  collective  investment  under­ taking's investment  strategy can result in significant investor losses. It is therefore essential that collective investment  undertakings  disclose  all  relevant  detailed  information  linked  to  their  use  of  SFTs  and  total  return swaps.  In  addition,  full  transparency  is  especially  relevant  in  the  area  of  collective  investment  undertakings  as  the entirety  of  assets  that  are  subject  to  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps  are  not  owned  by  the  managers  of  collective investment  undertakings  but  by  their  investors.  Full  disclosure  as  regards  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps  is  therefore an  essential  tool  to  safeguard  against  possible  conflicts  of  interest.

- (17) The  new  rules  on  transparency  of  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps  are  closely  linked  to  Directives  2009/65/EC (  1 )  and 2011/61/EU (  2  )  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  since  those  Directives  form  the  legal  framework governing  the  establishment,  management  and  marketing  of  collective  investment  undertakings.
- (18) Collective  investment  undertakings  may  operate  as  undertakings  for  collective  investment  in  transferable  securities (UCITS)  managed  by  UCITS  management  companies  or  by  UCITS  investment  companies  authorised  under Directive 2009/65/EC or as alternative investment funds (AIFs) managed by alternative investment fund managers  (AIFMs)  authorised  or  registered  under  Directive  2011/61/EU.  The  new  rules  on  transparency  of  SFTs and  total  return  swaps  introduced  by  this  Regulation  supplement,  and  should  apply  in  addition  to,  the  provisions of  those  Directives.
- (19) In  order  to  enable  investors  to  become  aware  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps, managers  of  collective  investment  undertakings  should  include  detailed  information  on  any  recourse  they  have  to those  techniques  in  periodical  reports.  The  existing  periodical  reports  that  UCITS  management  companies  or UCITS  investment  companies  and  AIFMs  have  to  produce  should  be  supplemented  by  the  additional  information on  the  use  of  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps.  In  further  specifying  the  content  of  those  periodical  reports,  ESMA should  take  into  account  the  administrative  burden  and  the  specificities  of  different  types  of  SFTs  and  total  return swaps.
- (20) A  collective  investment  undertaking's  investment  policy  with  respect  to  SFTs  and  total  return  swaps  should  be clearly  disclosed  in  the  pre-contractual  documents,  such  as  the  prospectus  for  UCITS  and  the  pre-contractual disclosure  to  investors  for  AIFs.  This  should  ensure  that  investors  understand  and  appreciate  the  inherent  risks before  they  decide  to  invest  in  a  particular  UCITS  or  AIF.
- (21) Reuse  of  collateral  provides  liquidity  and  enables  counterparties  to  reduce  funding  costs.  However,  it  tends  to create  complex  collateral  chains  between  traditional  banking  and  shadow  banking,  giving  rise  to  financial  stability risks. The lack of transparency on the extent to which financial instruments provided as collateral have been reused and the respective risks in the case of bankruptcy can undermine confidence in counterparties and magnify risks to financial  stability.
- (22) In  order  to  increase  transparency  of  reuse,  minimum  information  requirements  should  be  imposed.  Reuse  should take  place  only  with  the  express  knowledge  and  consent  of  the  providing  counterparty.  The  exercise  of  a  right  to reuse  should  therefore  be  reflected  in  the  securities  account  of  the  providing  counterparty  unless  that  account  is governed  by  the  law  of  a  third  country  which  provides  for  other  appropriate  means  to  reflect  the  reuse.
- (23) Although the scope of the rules concerning reuse in this Regulation is wider than that  of  Directive 2002/47/EC  of the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council (  3 ),  this  Regulation  does  not  amend  the  scope  of  that  Directive  but should, rather, be  read  in  addition  to  that  Directive. The  conditions  subject to  which counterparties have  a  right to reuse  and  to  exercise  that  right  should  not  in  any  way  diminish  the  protection  afforded  to  a  title  transfer  financial collateral arrangement under Directive 2002/47/EC. Against that background, any infringement of the transparency requirements  of  reuse  should  not  affect  national  law  concerning  the  validity  or  effect  of  a  transaction.
- (24) This  Regulation  establishes  strict  information  rules  for  counterparties  on  reuse  which  should  not  prejudice  the application  of  sectorial  rules  adapted  to  specific  actors,  structures  and  situations.  Therefore,  the  rules  on  reuse provided  for  in  this  Regulation  should  apply,  for  example,  to  collective  investment  undertakings  and  depositories or  clients  of  investment  firms  only  insofar  as  no  more  stringent  rules  on  reuse  are  provided  for  in  the  legal framework for collective investment undertakings or for safeguarding of client assets constituting a lex  specialis and taking  precedence  over  the  rules  contained  in  this  Regulation.  In  particular,  this  Regulation  should  be  without prejudice to any rule under Union law or national law restricting the ability of counterparties to engage in reuse of financial  instruments  that  are  provided  as  collateral  by  counterparties  or  persons  other  than  counterparties.  The application  of  the  reuse  requirements  should  be  deferred  to  six  months  after  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  this Regulation  in  order  to  provide  counterparties  with  sufficient  time  to  adapt  their  outstanding  collateral  arrange­ ments,  including  master  agreements,  and  to  ensure  that  new  collateral  arrangements  comply  with  this  Regulation.

- (25) In  order  to  promote  international  consistency  of  terminology,  the  use  of  the  term  'reuse'  in  this  Regulation  is  in line  with  the  FSB  Policy  Framework.  This  should  not,  however,  lead  to  inconsistency  within  the  Union acquis and, in  particular,  should  be  without  prejudice  to  the  meaning  of  the  term  'reuse'  employed  in  Directives  2009/65/EC and  2011/61/EU.
- (26) In  order  to  ensure  compliance  by  counterparties  with  the  obligations  deriving  from  this  Regulation  and  that  they are subject to similar treatment across the Union, Member States should ensure that competent authorities have the power to impose administrative sanctions and other administrative measures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  Therefore,  administrative  sanctions  and  other  administrative  measures  laid  down  in  this  Regulation should  satisfy  certain  essential  requirements  in  relation  to  addressees,  criteria  to  be  taken  into  account  when applying  a  sanction  or  measure,  publication  of  sanctions  or  measures,  key  powers  to  impose  sanctions  and  levels of  administrative  pecuniary  sanctions.  It  is  appropriate  that  sanctions  and  other  measures  established  under Directives  2009/65/EC  and  2011/61/EU  apply  to  infringements  of  the  transparency  obligations  relating  to  the collective  investment  undertakings  under  this  Regulation.
- (27) The  powers  to  impose  sanctions  conferred  on  competent  authorities  should  be  without  prejudice  to  the  exclusive competence of the  ECB,  pursuant to  Article  4(1)(a)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1024/2013,  to  withdraw  authorisations of  credit  institutions  for  prudential  supervisory  purposes.
- (28) Provisions  in  this  Regulation  regarding  the  application  for  registration  of  trade  repositories  and  the  withdrawal  of registration  do  not  affect  the  remedies  provided  for  in  Chapter  V  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1095/2010.
- (29) Technical standards in the financial services sector should ensure consistent harmonisation and adequate protection of  depositors,  investors  and  consumers  across  the  Union.  As  a  body  with  highly specialised expertise, it  is  efficient and  appropriate  to  entrust  ESMA  with  the  development  of  draft  regulatory  technical  and  implementing  standards which  do  not  involve  policy  choices.  ESMA  should  ensure  efficient  administrative  and  reporting  processes  when drafting  technical  standards.  The  Commission  should  be  empowered  to  adopt  regulatory  technical  standards  by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No  1095/2010  in  the  following  areas:  the  details  to  be  reported  for  different  types  of  SFTs;  the  details  of  the application for registration or extension of the registration of a trade repository; the details of the procedures to be applied by trade repositories in order to verify the details of SFTs reported to them; the frequency and the details of publication  of,  the  requirements  for,  and  the  access  to,  trade  repositories'  data;  and,  if  necessary,  the  further specification  of  the  content  of  the  Annex.
- (30) The  Commission should be  empowered to  adopt implementing  technical standards developed by  ESMA  by  means of  implementing  acts  pursuant  to  Article  291  TFEU  and  in  accordance  with  Article  15  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 1095/2010  with  regard  to  the  format  and  frequency  of  the  reports,  the  format  of  the  application  for  registration or  extension  of  the  registration  of  a  trade  repository,  as  well  as  the  procedures  and  forms  for  exchange  of information  on  sanctions  and  other  measures  with  ESMA.
- (31) The  power  to  adopt  acts  in  accordance  with  Article  290  TFEU  should  be  delegated  to  the  Commission  in  respect of  amending  the  list  of  entities  that  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  this  Regulation  and  of  the  type  of  fees,  the matters  for  which  fees  are  due,  the  amount  of  the  fees  and  the  manner  in  which  they  are  to  be  paid  by  trade repositories.  It  is  of  particular  importance  that  the  Commission  carry  out  appropriate  consultations  during  its preparatory  work,  including  at  expert  level.  The  Commission,  when  preparing  and  drawing  up  delegated  acts, should  ensure  a  simultaneous,  timely  and  appropriate  transmission  of  relevant  documents  to  the  European Parliament  and  to  the  Council.
- (32) In  order  to  ensure  uniform  conditions  for  the  implementation  of  this  Regulation,  implementing  powers  should  be conferred  on  the  Commission  to  take  decisions  on  the  assessment  of  the  rules  of  third  countries  for  the  purposes of  recognising  third-country  trade  repositories,  and  in  order  to  avoid  potentially  duplicate  or  conflicting  require­ ments.  The  assessment  which  forms  the  basis  of  decisions  on  equivalence  of  reporting  requirements  in  a  third country  should  not  prejudice  the  right  of  a  trade  repository  established  in  that  third  country  and  recognised  by ESMA  to  provide  reporting  services  to  entities  established  in  the  Union,  as  a  recognition  decision  should  be independent  of  such  an  assessment  for  the  purposes  of  an  equivalence  decision.
- (33) Where  an  implementing  act  on  equivalence  is  withdrawn,  counterparties  should  automatically  be  subject  again  to all  of  the  requirements  laid  down  in  this  Regulation.
- (34) Where  appropriate, the  Commission  should  cooperate  with  third-country  authorities  in  order  to  explore  mutually supportive solutions to ensure consistency between this Regulation and the requirements established by those third countries  and  thus  avoid  any  possible  duplication  in  this  respect.

- (35) Since  the  objectives of  this  Regulation, namely  enhancing  the  transparency of  certain activities in  financial  markets such  as  the  use  of  SFTs  and  reuse  of  collateral  in  order  to  enable  the  monitoring  and  identification  of  the corresponding  risks,  cannot  be  sufficiently  achieved  by  the  Member  States  but  can  rather,  by  reason  of  the scale  and  effects  of  this  Regulation,  be  better  achieved  at  Union  level,  the  Union  may  adopt  measures,  in accordance  with  the  principle  of  subsidiarity  as  set  out  in  Article  5  of  the  Treaty  on  European  Union.  In accordance  with  the  principle  of  proportionality  as  set  out  in  that  Article,  this  Regulation  does  not  go  beyond what  is  necessary  in  order  to  achieve  those  objectives.
- (36) This  Regulation  respects  the  fundamental  rights  and  observes  the  principles  recognised  in  the  Charter  of  Funda­ mental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, the right to respect for  private  and  family  life,  the  rights  of  the  defence  and  the  principle  of ne  bis  in  idem ,  the  freedom  to  conduct  a business,  the  right  to  property, the  right  to  an  effective  remedy  and  to  a  fair  trial.  This  Regulation  must  be  applied according  to  those  rights  and  principles.
- (37) The  European  Data  Protection  Supervisor  was  consulted  in  accordance  with  Article  28(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 45/2001  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council (  1  )  and  delivered  an  opinion  on  11  July  2014 (  2 ).
- (38) Any  exchange  or  transmission  of  personal  data  by  competent  authorities  of  the  Member  States  or  by  trade repositories  should  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  rules  on  the  transfer  of  personal  data  as  laid  down in  Directive  95/46/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council (  3  ).  Any  exchange  or  transmission  of personal  data  by  ESMA,  EBA  or  EIOPA  should  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  rules  on  the  transfer  of personal  data  as  laid  down  in  Regulation  (EC)  No  45/2001.
- (39) With the assistance of ESMA, the Commission should monitor and prepare reports to the European Parliament and to  the  Council  on  the  international  application  of  the  reporting  obligation  laid  down  in  this  Regulation.  The  time provided  for  submission  of  the  Commission  reports  should  allow  for  the  prior  effective  application  of  this Regulation.
- (40) Following  the  outcome  of  the  work  carried  out  by  relevant  international  fora,  and  with  the  assistance  of  ESMA, EBA  and  the  ESRB,  the  Commission  should  submit  a  report  to  the  European  Parliament  and  to  the  Council  on progress in  international  efforts  to  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with  SFTs,  including  the  FSB  recommendations  for haircuts  on  non-centrally  cleared  SFTs,  and  on  the  appropriateness  of  those  recommendations  for  Union  markets.
- (41) The  application  of  the  transparency  requirements  laid  down  in  this  Regulation  should  be  deferred  in  order  to provide  trade  repositories  with  sufficient  time  to  apply  for  the  authorisation  and  recognition  of  their  activities provided  for  in  this  Regulation,  and  counterparties  and  collective  investment  undertakings  with  sufficient  time  to comply with  those  requirements.  In  particular, it  is  appropriate  to  defer  the  application  of  additional  transparency requirements  for  collective  investment  undertakings,  taking  into  account  the  Guidelines  for  competent  authorities and  UCITS  management  companies  issued  by  ESMA  on  18  December  2012  which  lay  down  an  optional framework  for  UCITS  management  companies  regarding  disclosure  obligations  and  the  need  to  reduce  the administrative  burden  of  managers  of  collective  investment  undertakings.  In  order  to  ensure  the  effective  imple­ mentation  of  the  reporting  of  SFTs,  a  phase-in  of  the  application  of  the  requirements  by  type  of  counterparty  is necessary.  Such  an  approach should  take  into  account  the  effective  ability  of  the  counterparty  to  comply  with  the reporting  obligations  laid  down  in  this  Regulation.
- (42) The  new  uniform  rules  on  the  transparency  of  SFTs  and  certain  over-the-counter  (OTC)  derivatives,  namely  total return  swaps,  laid  down  in  this  Regulation  are  closely  linked  to  the  rules  laid  down  in  Regulation  (EU)  No 648/2012,  as  those  OTC  derivatives  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  reporting  requirements  laid  down  in  that Regulation.  In  order  to  ensure  a  coherent  scope  of  both  sets  of  transparency  and  reporting  requirements,  a clear  delineation  between  OTC  derivatives  and  exchange-traded  derivatives  is  needed  irrespective  of  whether those  contracts  are  traded  in  the  Union  or  in  third-country  markets.  The  definition  of  OTC  derivatives  in

(  1  )  Regulation (EC)  No  45/2001  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  18  December  2000  on  the  protection  of  individuals with  regard  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  by  the  Community  institutions  and  bodies  and  on  the  free  movement  of  such  data (OJ  L  8,  12.1.2001,  p.  1).

( 2 )  OJ  C  328,  20.9.2014,  p.  3.

(  3  )  Directive 95/46/EC  of  the  European Parliament and  of  the  Council  of  24  October  1995  on  the  protection of  individuals with  regard to  the  processing  of  personal  data  and  on  the  free  movement  of  such  data  (OJ  L  281,  23.11.1995,  p.  31).

<!-- image -->

Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  should  therefore  be  amended  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  same  type  of  derivatives contracts  are  identified  as  either  OTC  derivatives  or  exchange-traded  derivatives  irrespective  of  whether  those contracts  are  traded  in  the  Union  or  in  third-country  markets.

- (43) Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  should  therefore  be  amended  accordingly,

HAVE  ADOPTED  THIS  REGULATION:

1. This  Regulation  applies  to:
2. (a) a  counterparty  to  an  SFT  that  is  established:
3. (i)  in  the  Union,  including  all  its  branches  irrespective  of  where  they  are  located;
4. (ii)  in  a  third  country,  if  the  SFT  is  concluded  in  the  course  of  the  operations  of  a  branch  in  the  Union  of  that counterparty;
5. (b)  management  companies  of  undertakings  for  collective  investment  in  transferable  securities  (UCITS)  and  UCITS investment  companies  in  accordance  with  Directive  2009/65/EC;
6. (c) managers  of  alternative  investment  funds  (AIFMs)  authorised  in  accordance  with  Directive  2011/61/EU;
7. (d)  a  counterparty  engaging  in  reuse  that  is  established:
8. (i)  in  the  Union,  including  all  its  branches  irrespective  of  where  they  are  located;
9. (ii)  in  a  third  country,  where  either:
-  the  reuse  is  effected  in  the  course  of  the  operations  of  a  branch  in  the  Union  of  that  counterparty,  or
-  the reuse concerns financial instruments provided under a collateral arrangement by a counterparty established in  the  Union  or  a  branch  in  the  Union  of  a  counterparty  established  in  a  third  country.
2. Articles  4  and  15  do  not  apply  to:
13. (a)  members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), other Member States' bodies performing similar functions, and  other  Union  public  bodies  charged  with,  or  intervening  in,  the  management  of  the  public  debt;
14. (b)  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements.

3. Article  4  does  not  apply  to  transactions  to  which  a  member  of  the  ESCB  is  a  counterparty.
4. The  Commission  shall  be  empowered  to  adopt  delegated  acts  in  accordance  with  Article  30  to  amend  the  list  set out  in  paragraph  2  of  this  Article.

To that end and before adopting such delegated acts, the Commission shall present to the European Parliament and to the Council  a  report  assessing  the  international  treatment  of  central  banks  and  of  public  bodies  charged  with  or  intervening in  the  management  of  the  public  debt.

That  report  shall  include  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  treatment  of  central  banks  and  of  those  bodies  within  the  legal framework  of  a  number  of  third  countries.  Provided  that  the  report  concludes,  in particular  with regard  to the comparative  analysis  and  potential  effects,  that  the  exemption  of  the  monetary  responsibilities  of  those  third-country central banks and bodies from Article 15 is necessary, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act adding them to the list set  out  in  paragraph  2  of  this  Article.

## CHAPTER  II

## TRANSPARENCY  OF  SFTS

## Article  4

## Reporting  obligation  and  safeguarding  in  respect  of  SFTs

1. Counterparties  to  SFTs  shall  report  the  details  of  any  SFT  they  have  concluded,  as  well  as  any  modification  or termination  thereof,  to  a  trade  repository  registered  in  accordance  with  Article  5  or  recognised  in  accordance  with Article  19.  Those  details  shall  be  reported  no  later  than  the  working  day  following  the  conclusion,  modification  or termination  of  the  transaction.

The  reporting  obligation  laid  down  in  the  first  subparagraph  shall  apply  to  SFTs  which:

- (a)  were concluded before the relevant date of application referred to in point (a) of Article 33(2) and remain outstanding on  that  date,  if:
- (i)  the  remaining  maturity  of  those  SFTs  on  that  date  exceeds  180  days;  or
- (ii)  those  SFTs  have  an  open  maturity  and  remain  outstanding  180  days  after  that  date;

2. A  counterparty  which  is  subject  to  the  reporting  obligation  may  delegate  the  reporting  of  the  details  of  SFTs.

2. (a)  the  providing  counterparty  has  been  duly  informed  in  writing  by  the  receiving  counterparty  of  the  risks  and consequences  that  may  be  involved  in  one  of  the  following:

5. (b)  the  providing counterparty has granted its prior express consent, as evidenced by a signature, in writing or in a legally equivalent  manner,  of  the  providing  counterparty  to  a  security  collateral  arrangement,  the  terms  of  which  provide  a right  of  use  in  accordance  with  Article  5  of  Directive  2002/47/EC,  or  has  expressly  agreed  to  provide  collateral  by way  of  a  title  transfer  collateral  arrangement.

With regard to  point  (a)  of  the  first  subparagraph, the  providing  counterparty shall  at  least  be  informed  in  writing  of  the risks  and  consequences  that  may  arise  in  the  event  of  the  default  of  the  receiving  counterparty.

## RELATIONSHIP  WITH  THIRD  COUNTRIES

## Article  19

## Equivalence  and  recognition  of  trade  repositories

1. The  Commission  may  adopt  implementing  acts  determining  that  the  legal  and  supervisory  arrangements  of  a  third country  ensure  that:
2. (a) trade  repositories  authorised  in  that  third  country  comply  with  legally  binding  requirements  which  are  equivalent  to those  laid  down  in  this  Regulation;
3. (b)  effective  supervision  of  trade  repositories  and  effective  enforcement  of  their  obligations  takes  place  in  that  third country  on  an  ongoing  basis;

5. (d)  trade  repositories  authorised  in  that  third  country  are  subject  to  a  legally  binding  and  enforceable  obligation  to  give direct  and  immediate  access  to  the  data  to  the  entities  referred  to  in  Article  12(2).

The implementing act referred to in the first subparagraph shall also specify the relevant third-country authorities that are entitled  to  access  the  data  on  SFTs  held  in  trade  repositories  established  in  the  Union.

The  implementing  act  referred  to  in  the  first  subparagraph  of  this  paragraph  shall  be  adopted  in  accordance  with  the examination  procedure  referred  to  in  Article  31(2).

2. Where  trade  repositories  authorised  in  a  third  country  are  not  subject  to  a  legally  binding  and  enforceable obligation  under  the  law  of  that  third  country  to  give  direct  and  immediate  access  to  the  data  to  the  entities  referred to  in  Article  12(2),  the  Commission  shall  submit  recommendations  to  the  Council  for  the  negotiation  of  international agreements  with  that  third  country  regarding  mutual  access  to,  and  exchange  of,  information  on  SFTs  held  in  trade repositories  which  are  established  in  that  third  country,  in  order  to  ensure  that  all  of the entities referred  to in Article  12(2)  have  direct  and  immediate  access  to  all  of  the  information  needed  for  the  exercise  of  their  duties.
3. A trade  repository established  in  a  third  country  may  provide  its  services  and  activities to  entities  established  in  the Union for the purposes of Article 4 only after its recognition by ESMA in accordance with the requirements laid down in paragraph  4  of  this  Article.
4. A  trade  repository  referred  to  in  paragraph  3  shall  submit  to  ESMA  either  of  the  following:
4. (a) an  application  for  recognition;
5. (b)  an  application  for  extension  of  the  registration  for  the  purposes  of  Article  4  of  this  Regulation  in  the  case  of  a  trade repository  already  recognised  in  accordance  with  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012.
5. An  application  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  shall  be  accompanied  by  all  necessary  information,  including  at  least the  information  necessary  to  verify  that  the  trade  repository  is  authorised  and  subject  to  effective  supervision  in  a  third country  which  satisfies  all  of  the  following  criteria:
7. (a) the  Commission  has  determined,  by  means  of  an  implementing  act  pursuant  to  paragraph  1,  that  the  third  country has  an  equivalent  and  enforceable  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework;
8. (b)  the  relevant  authorities  of  the  third  country  have  entered  into  cooperation  arrangements  with  ESMA  specifying  at least:
9. (i)  a  mechanism  for  the  exchange  of  information  between  ESMA  and  any  other  Union  authority  that  exercises responsibilities  as  a  result  of  any  delegation  of  tasks  pursuant  to  Article  9(1)  on  the  one  hand  and  the  relevant competent  authorities  of  the  third  country  concerned  on  the  other;  and
10. (ii)  procedures  concerning  the  coordination  of  supervisory  activities.

ESMA  shall  apply  Regulation  (EC)  No  45/2001  with  regard  to  the  transfer  of  personal  data  to  a  third  country.

6. Within  30  working  days  of  receipt  of  the  application,  ESMA  shall  assess  whether  the  application  is  complete.  If ESMA determines that the application is not complete, it shall set a deadline by which the applicant trade repository is to provide  additional  information.
7. Within  180  working  days  of  the  submission  of  a  complete  application,  ESMA  shall  inform  the  applicant  trade repository  in  writing  with  a  fully  reasoned  explanation  whether  the  recognition  has  been  granted  or  refused.
8. ESMA  shall  publish  on  its  website  a  list  of  the  trade  repositories  recognised  in  accordance  with  this  Article.

## Article  20

## Indirect  access  to  data  between  authorities

ESMA  may  conclude  cooperation  arrangements  with  relevant  authorities  of  third  countries  that  need  to  fulfil  their respective  responsibilities  and  mandates  regarding  mutual  exchange  of  information  on  SFTs  made  available  to  ESMA

by  Union  trade  repositories  in  accordance  with  Article  12(2)  and  on  SFT  data  collected  and  maintained  by  third-country authorities,  provided  that  guarantees  of  professional  secrecy  exist,  including  with  regard  to  the  protection  of  business secrets  shared  by  the  authorities  with  third  parties.

## Article  21

## Equivalence  of  reporting

1. The Commission may adopt implementing acts determining that the legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements  of  a  third  country:
2. (a) are  equivalent  to  the  requirements  laid  down  in  Article  4;
3. (b)  ensure  protection  of  professional  secrecy  equivalent  to  that  laid  down  in  this  Regulation;
4. (c) are  being  effectively  applied  and  enforced  in  an  equitable  and  non-distortive  manner  in  order  to  ensure  effective supervision  and  enforcement  in  that  third  country;  and
5. (d)  ensure  that  the  entities  referred  to  in  Article  12(2)  have  either  direct  access  to  the  details  on  SFT  data  pursuant  to Article  19(1)  or  indirect  access  to  the  details  on  SFTs  pursuant  to  Article  20.
2. Where the Commission has adopted an implementing act on equivalence with regard to a third country, as referred to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Article,  counterparties  entering  into  a  transaction  subject  to  this  Regulation  shall  be  deemed  to have  fulfilled  the  requirements  laid  down  in  Article  4  where  at  least  one  of  the  counterparties  is  established  in  that  third country  and  the  counterparties  have  complied  with  the  relevant  obligations  of  that  third  country  in  relation  to  that transaction.

That  implementing  act  shall  be  adopted  in  accordance  with  the  examination  procedure  referred  to  in  Article  31(2).

The Commission shall, in  cooperation with ESMA, monitor  the effective implementation  by third  countries  for  which an implementing  act  on  equivalence  has  been  adopted  of  the  requirements  equivalent  to  those  laid  down  in  Article  4  and report  regularly  to  the  European  Parliament  and  to  the  Council.  Where  the  report  reveals  an  insufficient  or  inconsistent application  of  the  equivalent  requirements  by  third-country  authorities,  the  Commission  shall  consider,  within  30 calendar  days  of  the  presentation  of  the  report,  whether  to  withdraw  the  recognition  as  equivalent  of  the  thirdcountry  legal  framework  in  question.

Without  prejudice  to  Article  28  and  the  right  of  Member  States  to  provide  for  and  impose  criminal  sanctions, Member  States  shall,  in  accordance  with  national  law,  provide  for  competent  authorities  to  have  the  power  to  impose administrative  sanctions  and  other  administrative  measures  in  relation  to  at  least  infringements  of  Articles  4  and  15.

Where  the  provisions  referred  to  in  the  first  subparagraph  apply  to  legal  persons,  Member  States  shall  empower competent  authorities,  in  the  case  of  an  infringement,  to  apply  sanctions,  subject  to  the  conditions  laid  down  in national  law,  to  members  of  the  management  body,  and  to  other  individuals  who  under  national  law  are  responsible for  the  infringement.

2. The  administrative  sanctions  and  other  administrative  measures  taken  for  the  purpose  of  paragraph  1  shall  be effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive.

3. Where Member States have chosen, in  accordance with  paragraph 1  of  this  Article,  to  lay  down  criminal  sanctions for  the  infringements  of  the  provisions  referred  to  in  that  paragraph  they  shall  ensure  that  appropriate  measures  are  in place so that competent authorities have all of the necessary powers to liaise with judicial, prosecuting, or criminal justice authorities  within  their  jurisdiction  to  receive  specific  information  related  to  criminal  investigations  or  proceedings commenced  for  possible  infringements  of  Articles  4  and  15,  and  to  provide  such  information  to  other  competent authorities  and  ESMA  to  fulfil  their  obligation  to  cooperate  with  each  other  and,  where  relevant,  with  ESMA  for  the purposes  of  this  Regulation.

Competent  authorities  may  cooperate  with  competent  authorities  of  other  Member  States  and  relevant  third-country authorities  with  respect  to  the  exercise  of  their  powers  to  impose  sanctions.

Competent authorities may also cooperate with  competent authorities of  other Member  States  with  respect to  facilitating the  recovery  of  pecuniary  sanctions.

4. Member States  shall,  in  accordance  with  national  law,  confer  on  competent  authorities  the  power  to  apply  at  least the  following  administrative  sanctions  and  other  administrative  measures  in  the  event  of  the  infringements  referred  to  in paragraph  1:

For  the  purpose  of  point  (g)(i)  and  (ii)  of  the  first  subparagraph,  where  the  legal  person  is  a  parent  undertaking  or  a subsidiary  of  the  parent  undertaking  which  has  to  prepare  consolidated  financial  accounts  in  accordance  with  Directive 2013/34/EU,  the  relevant  total  annual  turnover  shall  be  the  total  annual  turnover  or  the  corresponding  type  of  income according  to  the  relevant  accounting  regime  according  to  the  last  available  consolidated  accounts  approved  by  the management  body  of  the  ultimate  parent  undertaking.

6. Member States may decide not  to  lay down  rules  for  administrative sanctions  and  other  administrative measures  as referred to  in  paragraph 1  where the  infringements  referred to  in  that  paragraph are  already subject to  criminal sanctions in  their  national  law  before  13  January  2018.  Where  they  decide  not  to  lay  down  rules  for  administrative  sanctions  and other  administrative  measures,  Member  States  shall  notify,  in  detail,  to  the  Commission  and  to  ESMA,  the  relevant  parts of  their  criminal  law.

7. By  13  July  2017  Member  States  shall  notify  the  rules  regarding  paragraphs  1,  3  and  4  to  the  Commission  and  to ESMA.  They  shall  notify  the  Commission  and  ESMA  without  delay  of  any  subsequent  amendment  thereto.

## Article  23

- (e) the  level  of  cooperation  of  the  person  responsible  for  the  infringement  with  the  competent  authority,  without prejudice  to  the  need  to  ensure  disgorgement  of  profits  gained  or  losses  avoided  by  that  person;
- (f) previous  infringements  by  the  person  responsible  for  the  infringement.

Competent  authorities  may  take  into  account  additional  factors  to  those  referred  to  in  the  first  paragraph  when  deter­ mining  the  type  and  level  of  administrative  sanctions  and  other  administrative  measures.

## Article  24

## Article  26

## Publication  of  decisions

1. Subject  to  paragraph  4  of  this  Article,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  competent  authorities  publish  any  decision imposing  an  administrative  sanction  or  other  administrative  measure  in  relation  to  infringements  of  Article  4  or  15  on their  website  immediately  after  the  person  subject  to  that  decision  has  been  informed  of  that  decision.
2. The  information  published  pursuant  to  paragraph  1  shall  specify  at  least  the  type  and  nature  of  the  infringement and  the  identity  of  the  person  subject  to  the  decision.
3. Paragraphs  1  and  2  shall  not  apply  to  decisions  imposing  measures  that  are  of  an  investigatory  nature.

Where  a  competent  authority  considers,  following  a  case-by-case  assessment,  that  the  publication  of  the  identity  of  the legal  person  subject  to  the  decision,  or  the  personal  data  of  a  natural  person,  would  be  disproportionate,  or  where  such publication  would  jeopardise  an  ongoing  investigation  or  the  stability  of  the  financial  markets,  it  shall  do  one  of  the following:

- (a) defer  publication  of  the  decision  until  the  reasons  for  that  deferral  cease  to  exist;

<!-- image -->

- (b)  publish the decision on an anonymous basis in accordance with national law where such publication ensures effective protection  of  the  personal  data  concerned  and,  where  appropriate,  postpone  publication  of  the  relevant  data  for  a reasonable period of time where it is foreseeable that the reasons for anonymous publication will cease to exist during that  period;
- (c) not  publish  the  decision  in  the  event  that  the  competent  authority  is  of  the  opinion  that  publication  in  accordance with  point  (a)  or  (b)  will  be  insufficient  to  ensure:
- (i)  that  the  stability  of  financial  markets  is  not  jeopardised;  or
- (ii)  the  proportionality  of  the  publication  of  such  decisions  with  regard  to  measures  which  are  deemed  to  be  of  a minor  nature.

4. Where  the  decision  is  subject  to  an  appeal  before  a  national  judicial,  administrative  or  other  authority,  competent authorities  shall  also  publish  immediately  on  their  website  such  information  and  any  subsequent  information  on  the outcome  of  such  an  appeal.  Any  decision  annulling  a  decision  subject  to  appeal  shall  also  be  published.

5. Competent authorities shall inform ESMA of all administrative sanctions and other administrative measures imposed but  not  published, in  accordance with point  (c)  of  paragraph 3,  including  any  appeal in  relation  thereto and  the  outcome thereof.  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  competent  authorities receive  information  and  the  final  judgement  in  relation  to any  criminal  sanction  imposed  and  submit  it  to  ESMA.  ESMA  shall  maintain  a  central  database  of  administrative sanctions, other administrative measures and criminal sanctions communicated to it solely for the purposes of exchanging information between competent authorities. That database shall be accessible only to competent authorities and it shall be updated  on  the  basis  of  the  information  provided  by  the  competent  authorities.

6. Competent  authorities  shall  ensure  that  any  decision  that  is  published  in  accordance  with  this  Article  remain accessible  on  their  website  for  a  period  of  at  least  five  years  after  its  publication.  Personal  data  contained  in  those decisions  shall  be  retained  on  the  website  of  the  competent  authority  for  the  period  which  is  necessary,  in  accordance with  the  applicable  data  protection  rules.

## Article  27

## Right  of  appeal

Member  States  shall  ensure  that  decisions  and  measures  taken  pursuant  to  this  Regulation  are  properly  reasoned  and subject to a right of appeal before a tribunal. The right of appeal before a tribunal shall also apply where, in respect of an application for authorisation which provides all of the information required, no decision is taken within six months of its submission.

## Article  28

## Sanctions  and  other  measures  for  the  purpose  of  Articles  13  and  14

Sanctions  and  other  measures  established  in  accordance with  Directives 2009/65/EC  and  2011/61/EU  shall  be  applicable to  infringements  of  Articles  13  and  14  of  this  Regulation.

## CHAPTER  IX

## REVIEW

## Article  29

## Reports  and  review

1. Within  36  months  of  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  the  delegated  act  adopted  by  the  Commission  pursuant  to Article  4(9),  the  Commission  shall,  after  consulting  ESMA,  submit  a  report  on  the  effectiveness,  efficiency  and  propor­ tionality of the obligations laid down in this Regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with any appropriate  proposals.  That  report  shall  include,  in  particular,  an  overview  of  similar  reporting  obligations  laid  down  in third  countries  taking  into  account  work  at  international  level.  It  shall  also  focus  on  the  reporting  of  any  relevant transactions  not  included  in  the  scope  of  this  Regulation,  taking  into  account  any  significant  developments  in  market practices,  as  well  as  on  the  possible  impact  on  the  level  of  transparency  of  securities  financing  operations.

For  the  purposes  of  the  report  referred  to  in  the  first  subparagraph,  ESMA  shall,  within  24  months  of  the  date  of  entry into  force  of  the  delegated  act  adopted  by  the  Commission  pursuant  to  Article  4(9),  and  every  three  years  thereafter,  or more frequently where significant developments in  market practices arise, submit a report to the European Parliament, to the  Council  and  to  the  Commission  on  the  efficiency  of  the  reporting,  taking  into  account  the  appropriateness of  singleside reporting, in particular in terms of reporting coverage and quality as well as reduction of reports to trade repositories, and  on  significant  developments  in  market  practices with  a  focus  on  transactions  having  an  equivalent  objective or  effect to  an  SFT.

2. Following completion of, and taking into account, work at international level, the reports referred to in paragraph 1 shall  also  identify  material  risks  related  to  the  use  of  SFTs  by  credit  institutions  and  listed  companies  and  analyse  the appropriateness  of  providing  for  additional  disclosure  by  those  entities  in  their  periodical  reports.
3. By  13  October  2017,  the  Commission  shall  submit  a  report  to  the  European  Parliament  and  to  the  Council  on progress  in  international  efforts  to  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with  SFTs,  including  the  FSB  recommendations  for haircuts  on  non-centrally  cleared  SFTs,  and  on  the  appropriateness  of  those  recommendations  for  Union  markets.  The Commission  shall  submit  that  report  together  with  any  appropriate  proposals.

To  that  end,  ESMA  shall,  by  13  October  2016,  in  cooperation  with  EBA  and  the  ESRB  and  taking  due  account  of international  efforts,  submit  a  report  to  the  Commission,  to  the  European  Parliament  and  to  the  Council,  assessing:

- (a) whether  the  use  of  SFTs  leads  to  the  build-up  of  significant  leverage  that  is  not  addressed  by  existing  regulation;
- (b)  where  appropriate,  the  options  available  to  tackle  such  a  build-up;
- (c) whether  further  measures  to  reduce  the  pro-cyclicality  of  that  leverage  are  required.

ESMA's  report  shall  also  consider  the  quantitative  impact  of  the  FSB  recommendations.

4. Within 39 months of the entry into force of the delegated act adopted by the Commission pursuant to Article 4(9), and  within  six  months  of  submission  of  each  ESMA  report  as  referred  to  in  the  second  subparagraph  of  this  paragraph, the  Commission  shall,  after  consulting  ESMA,  submit  a  report  to  the  European  Parliament  and  to  the  Council  on  the application  of  Article  11  in  particular  on  whether  fees  that  have  been  charged  to  trade  repositories  are  proportionate  to the  turnover  of  the  trade  repository concerned  and  limited  to  fully  covering  ESMA's  necessary expenditure relating  to  the registration,  recognition  and  supervision  of  trade  repositories  as  well  as  the  reimbursement  of  any  costs  that  the competent authorities may incur carrying out work pursuant to this Regulation in particular as a result of  any delegation of  tasks  pursuant  to  Article  9(1).

For the purposes of the Commission's reports referred to in the first subparagraph, within 33 months of the date of entry into  force  of  the  delegated  act  adopted  by  the  Commission  pursuant  to  Article  4(9),  and  every  three  years  thereafter,  or more  frequently  where  material  changes  to  fees  are  introduced,  ESMA  shall  submit  a  report  to  the  Commission  on  the fees charged to trade repositories in accordance with this Regulation. Those reports shall set out at least ESMA's necessary expenditures  relating  to  the  registration,  recognition  and  supervision  of  trade  repositories,  the  costs  that  the  competent authorities incurred  carrying  out  work  pursuant  to  this  Regulation,  in  particular, as  a  result  of  any  delegation  of  tasks,  as well  as  the  fees  charged  to  trade  repositories  and  their  proportionality  to  trade  repositories'  turnover.

5. After  consulting  the  ESRB,  ESMA  shall  publish  an  annual  report  on  aggregate SFT  volumes  by  type  of  counterparty and  transaction  based  on  data  reported  in  accordance  with  Article  4.
