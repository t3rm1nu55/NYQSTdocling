THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 of  the European Parliament and of  the Council of 25 November 2015 on transparency  of  securities  financing  transactions  and  of  reuse  and  amending  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  ( 1 ),  and  in particular Article 4(9) thereof,

Whereas:

- (1) To increase efficiency and leverage similarities between the reporting of derivatives and the reporting of securities financing  transactions  ('SFTs'),  the  obligation  to  report  the  details  of  SFTs  to  trade  repositories  pursuant  to Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 should be aligned with the obligation to report derivative transactions to trade  repositories  pursuant  to  Article  9  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the Council  ( 2 ).  The  reporting  requirements  that  specify  the  details  of  SFTs  should  therefore  be  similar to  the reporting requirements that specify the details of derivative contracts.
- (2) To  ensure  the  efficiency  and  usefulness  of  reported  information  on  SFTs,  the  specific  details  of  the  SFTs  to  be reported should  be  adapted  to  the  different  types  of  SFTs  identified  in  Regulation  (EU)  2015/2365.  With  regards to  reporting  margin  lending  transactions,  the  purpose  of  Regulation  (EU)  2015/2365  is  to  capture  transactions that serve the same purpose as repurchase transactions, buy-sell back transactions or securities lending transactions  and  therefore  pose  similar  risks  to  financial  stability  by  allowing  the  build-up  of  leverage,  procyclicality  and  interconnectedness  in  financial  markets  or  by  contributing  to  liquidity  and  maturity  transforma­ tion.  While  margin  lending  therefore  includes  transactions  subject  to  margin  agreements  between  financial institutions  and  their  clients  where  financial  institutions  provide  prime  brokerage  services  to  their  clients,  it  does not  include  other  loans  such  as  loans  for  corporate  restructuring  purposes  which,  despite  the  possibility  of involving securities, do not contribute to the systemic risks addressed by Regulation (EU) 2015/2365.
- (3) It  is  important  that  the  details  of  any  SFT  cleared  by  a  central  counterparty  are  correctly  reported  and  can  be easily identified,  irrespective of whether  that SFT was cleared on the same date or on a later date than the date on which that SFT was concluded.
- (4) To ensure comprehensive reporting where specific details of  the collateral are not known on the day of  the trade, counterparties  should  update  information  on  the  collateral  as  soon  as  that  information  becomes  available  to  the counterparties, and no later  than the working day following the value date of that SFT.

## REGULATIONS

## COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/356 of 13 December 2018

supplementing  Regulation  (EU)  2015/2365  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with regard  to  regulatory  technical  standards  specifying  the  details  of  securities  financing  transactions (SFTs) to be reported to trade repositories

(Text with EEA relevance)

- (5) To provide more useful information to the authorities that access the details of SFTs in trade repositories, counter­ parties  should  report  to  the  trade  repositories  the  International  Securities  Identification  Number  ('ISIN')  of  any collateral basket they use to provide collateral to an SFT, if that basket has an ISIN.
- (6) Where  counterparties  provide  collateral  on  a  net  exposure  basis,  resulting  from  the  offsetting  of  a  number  of SFTs between two counterparties, a specific allocation of collateral to an individual SFT is often not possible, and hence  the  collateral  allocation  may  not  be  known.  In  those  situations,  counterparties  should  be  able  to  report collateral independently of the underlying loan.
- (7) This  Regulation  is  based  on  the  draft  regulatory  technical  standards  submitted  by  the  European  Securities  and Markets  Authority  ('ESMA')  to  the  Commission  pursuant  to  the  procedure  in  Article  10  of  Regulation  (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ).
- (8) ESMA  has  conducted  open  public  consultations  on  these  draft  regulatory  technical  standards,  analysed  the potential  related  costs  and  benefits  and  requested  the  opinion  of  the  ESMA  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

## Article 1

2. When  reporting  the  conclusion  of  an  SFT,  a  counterparty  shall  specify  in  its  report  the  action  type  'New'  in Field  98  in  Table  2  of  the  Annex  to  this  Regulation.  Any  subsequent  reports  of  the  details  of  that  SFT  shall  specify  in Field 98 in Table 2 of the Annex to this Regulation the relevant action type that relates to that SFT.
